PROJECT APPRENTICE CHEF - Halfway There Cross-Sell service

**AIM**: Of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict weather a customer will subscribe to Halfway There service.

**BACKGROUND**: Halfway There is a unique subscription in which subscribers will get half bottle of wine from local California vineyard every Wednesday.

**WHY**: Apprentice Chef want to diversify there revenue stream by adding a cross-sell service. Plus this will give Apprentice Chef competitive advantage based on its unique product offering of hard to find local wines.

**ASSUMPTION**: The dataset provided by the engineering team has used dataset engineering techniques and are statistically sound and represent the true picture of Apprentice Chefâ€™s customers.

*Tried and tested various Machine Learning models to understand which will be used for the final approach, and GBM without tuning has the highest AUC value.*
